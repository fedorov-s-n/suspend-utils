<td>
<p>A mutable reduction operation that accumulates input elements into a mutable result container, optionally
transforming the accumulated result into a final representation after all input elements have been processed.
Reduction operations can be performed either sequentially or in parallel, but collector may assume they are performed
sequentially, because all synchronization is done in stream implementation.</p>
